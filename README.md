#### Objective of this assignment

1. Dataset Selection – Choose a suitable multivariate dataset (from R/Python built-in datasets, Kaggle, or UCI).

2. Data Preparation – Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize if needed).

3. Multivariate Visualization – Apply at least four different techniques (e.g., Scatterplot Matrix, Parallel Coordinates Plot, Heatmap, PCA/t-SNE).

4. Pattern Interpretation – Analyze each visualization to identify clusters, correlations, and outliers.

5. Insights & Understanding – Explain how visualization helps in understanding relationships among multiple variables.

6. Report Writing – Summarize findings in a short report (2–3 pages) with plots, interpretations, and conclusions.

7. Code Submission – Attach the full code (R script/Jupyter Notebook) at the end of the report (not counted in page length).

8. Final Deliverable – Submit the report as a single PDF file via Moodle.
